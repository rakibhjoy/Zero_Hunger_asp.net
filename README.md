Zero Hunger 

User Story: We need a system that will help us to automate and track our works. We are an NGO who works for feeding deprived people and children. We have observed that, people are wasting a ton of food every day in Dhaka city (like office programs, buffets etc etc). We are on a mission to make the usage of this foods. We have contacted with some restaurants, and they agreed to give us those foods before it gets rotten, or they will preserve those foods till we collect from them. We have some employees and still enrolling. Let me tell the workflow,  

restaurants will open a collect request from their dashboard with the maximum time they can preserve. 

We will accept collect request and assign an employee to collect the foods. 

After collection the foods will be distributed by our employee and upon completion the collect request will be completed. 

System also needs to track all collect requests and their details.
